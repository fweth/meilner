      I am a cinematographer focusing on documentary, fictional and advertorial
      projects that investigate socially relevant topics.

      Shaping light and composing images is a powerful tool to emotionally catch
      the audience, making them reflect on issues and phenomena they're possibly
      unaware of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides entertainment, i see our responsibility as filmmakers to use that
      power for making a positive impact, regardless of what extent.
